for loops are most useful when one needs to keep track of some counter or number that is modified in a consistent way
each iteration through a loop and/or you can predict or compute how many iterations are needed. A while loop, however,
is more appropriate when one wants to wait to terminate until some condition is met, but it's not possible or not
straightforward to compute when that will come to pass.
